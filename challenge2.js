/* 
    Life in Weeks - Code Challenge

    In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many months we have left if we live until 90 years old

    It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:

    You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

    Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

    For this challenge, assume there are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.

    Important: your console.log output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

    Example Input
    E.g. If you are 56 years old:
        lifeInWeeks(56);

    Example Output
        You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
